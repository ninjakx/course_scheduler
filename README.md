The head of the Learning management system (LMS) has hired you as a consultant. The LMS team has the goal of upskilling the employees with the latest topics via courses. You need to help build a system to schedule and manage the courses. 

## Pre-requisites
* Python 3.8/3.9

 ## How to execute the unit tests

 `python -m unittest discover` will execute the unit test cases.

 The unit test coverage is found by the command :
`coverage run -m unittest discover`

This covers Design patterns like singleton, also uses interfaces and following:

**Object Modelling (OOPS)** 
- Solution follows some modelling principles. 
- Code maintains encapsulation. No encapsulation breakages were found. 

**Readability**
- Solution follows clean code principles and is well readable.
- Code follows the single responsibility principle.
- Code is structured and split across multiple files thereby improving its readability.
- Code is written with compact methods. Shorter, compact methods help in improving readability.
- Code has good usage of easily understandable names for methods, classes, and variables. This makes code easy to understand.
- Submission has very few magic numbers, making it easy to read and maintain. 

**Unit Tests** 
- Contains all the unit tests for every methods.

**Build**
- Not getting build there :/ but works fine in the local environment.


**Maintainability** 
- Code is maintainable. It doesnâ€™t contain complex methods. Code is spread evenly across methods.
- Code had minimal code duplication. The submission follows DRY principles. This helps in increasing readability and helps in maintaining code. 

**Correctness( I/O)**
Some issue in the portal side not running there.
